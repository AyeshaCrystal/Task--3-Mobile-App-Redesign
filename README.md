Task--3-Mobile-App-Redesign
ZapPay is a redesigned version of a mobile payment app, inspired by Google Pay. The main goal of this redesign is to make the home screen cleaner and more user-friendly, especially for new users.

🔍 Pain Point
The GPay home screen is cluttered with too many action buttons, cards, and promotions — making it difficult for users to quickly find what they need, especially for basic tasks like paying bills or sending money.

💡 My Redesign Solution
- ✅ Introduced a **floating "Quick Pay" button** for immediate UPI actions
- ✅ Grouped people, bills, and businesses into **collapsible cards**
- ✅ Moved secondary actions (offers, gold, refer & earn) to a **hamburger menu**
- ✅ Used a **bottom navigation bar** for core actions (Home, Balance, Activity)
